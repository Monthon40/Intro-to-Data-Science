**Attendance Policy**

All classes are online. Students must join the conference session within the first 15 minutes. The camera shall be on. Three late is equivalent to one absent. Each absent will get 1% deduction (each late is 0.33% deduction). Students shall maintain at least 80% of the class time in order to take the final exam.
