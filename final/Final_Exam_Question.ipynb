More than 10000 customers post comments and ratings about your restaurant on google map (google allow users to post reviews of places). Each review on google map has both the text and the number of stars (from 1 to 5 stars). You pay Google to get the summary of the ratings/reviews as a csv file. Additional to Google Map reviews, you also notice that a lot of customers write about your restaurant on Twitter. You pay Twitter to send you a daily summary (a csv file) of all messages (posted on that day) that contain your restaurant name. The number of messages is quite high for you to read them all. You want to focus only on negative comments so that you can use that to improve your restaurant. What would you do to in order to bring to bad comments to you?
